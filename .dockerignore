# Step 1: Use the official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:18-alpine as build

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package.json package-lock.json* ./

# Install only production dependencies
RUN npm install --production --frozen-lockfile

# Copy the rest of the source code
COPY . .

# Build the Next.js application
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Create a smaller image to run the application
FROM node:18-alpine as production

# Set the working directory for the built application
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the necessary files from the build image
COPY --from=build /app/.next /app/.next
COPY --from=build /app/node_modules /app/node_modules
COPY --from=build /app/public /app/public
COPY package.json ./

# Expose the port where Next.js will run
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the Next.js application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
