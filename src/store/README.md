# Store

This folder contains the state management logic of the application. It can include Redux, Zustand, or any other state management solution to centralize and manage global state.

## Structure

- **store.js**: The main store file to initialize and manage application state.
- **actions**: Functions for dispatching state changes.
- **reducers**: Functions to handle state transitions.
- **selectors**: Functions to read state from the store.

## Usage

- Use the store to manage global state, including user authentication, theme settings, and other shared data.
- Actions and reducers should be used to update and access the state within the app.
